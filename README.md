# MLFlow Tutorial: Streamlining Your Machine Learning Lifecycle

This project provides a comprehensive guide to using **MLFlow**, an open-source platform designed to manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. MLFlow offers tools for experiment tracking, model packaging, and deployment, simplifying the process of bringing machine learning models from development to production.

## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- **Set up MLFlow** in your local environment.
- **Track experiments**, including parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
- **Package machine learning models** for reproducibility.
- **Deploy models** using MLFlow's built-in tools.

The tutorial covers practical examples to illustrate each component of MLFlow, ensuring you can apply these concepts to your own machine learning projects.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need:

- **Python 3.6** or higher.
- Familiarity with **machine learning concepts** and frameworks like scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
- **Pip** for installing Python packages.

## Installation

To get started, install MLFlow using pip:

```bash
pip install mlflow
